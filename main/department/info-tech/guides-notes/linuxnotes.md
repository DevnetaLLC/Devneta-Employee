# Notes on Linux
<br>

Due to Linux being a varied and powerful operating system, customization is likely at the forefront of your mind.
Devneta has no issues with employees taking the time to set up their work environment to be tailored to their workflow.
Examples include changing the desktop environment and installing packages that increase company device efficiency, functionality, and usability.
We ask that employees note times spent working on their workspace in their time cards. <br />

## Supported

> [!CAUTION]
> Devneta fully supports your endeavor in learning Linux. However, if you are a new user who decides to install a more complex distro (E.g., Arch or Gentoo), you will not be offered
> support. Linux is a learning process, and you can not learn by diving in the deep end.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Full Support → Fedora <br />
