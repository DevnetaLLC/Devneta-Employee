## Company Provided Devices

All devices provided by Devneta LLC must adhere to the following terms:

+ Company-provided devices must not be used for personal use without prior approval. This includes but is not limited to using personal social media, answering and sending personal calls or messages, and watching videos that are non-work related.
+ Company devices must not be connected to a public internet connection (E.g., free wifi at a public location). Devices must be used on a private internet connection (E.g., your home internet). Exceptions may be made when an employee travels for work and must use a public internet connection. In such cases, the employee may be asked to use a Virtual Private Network when connecting.
+ Company devices must not be tampered with. We have security measures in place to protect sensitive company data, and tampering could bypass these protections, allowing malicious attackers to access this data.
+ Company devices will not have unauthorized applications installed on them. This is due to security concerns. Refer to the above point. We maintain a list of [Support and Approved Applications](/main/department/human-resource/resources/handbook/support-approval.md) that can be installed without prior approval for your convenience.


## Personal Devices

Some employees may be using their personal devices for work. <br />
We can not control what you do with your personal device, but we ask that you use your best judgment. Personal devices can only be used by employees who have completed the [Cybersecurity Course](/main/department/human-resource/resources/handbook/usageoftech.md) and [Cybersecurity Test](/main/department/human-resource/resources/handbook/usageoftech.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If an employee is unsure, they can reach out to the [IT Department](mailto:it@devneta.org) for clarification.
