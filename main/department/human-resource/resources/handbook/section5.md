### Section 5.5 - Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

Under **_Section 125_** of the **_IRS Code_**, we have set up a flexible spending account for employees who wish to take advantage of this provision. <br />

This plan allows employees to withhold a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis to cover the cost of qualifying insurance premiums, out of pocket medical expenses, and dependant care expenses (child and, or elder care) such as day care expenses, and in-home dependent care. An amount selected by the employee is deducted on a pre-tax basis to cover these expenses. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> Any unused amounts in the medical and dependent care account will be forfeited after the end of the plan year.

### Section 5.6 - 401(k) Plan

Our 401(k) Plan is a convenient payroll deductible method to help supplement employees' retirement benefits and provide a long-term vehicle to accumulate savings. <br />

### Section 5.7 - Commuter Benefits

Under **_Section 132(f)_** of the **_IRS Code_**, we have setup a commuter benefit program for employees who wish to take advantage of this provision. <br />

This plan allows employees to withhold a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis to cover commuting costs via public transport or qualified parking for employees. When the employee pays part or all of the cost of public transportation via a pe-tax payroll deduction, the employee can set aside up to **$130.00** a month of pre-tax income. <br />


### Section 5.8 - COBRA

Under the provisions of the **_Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act_** ("**_COBRA_**") of **_1986_**, if you are covered under our group health insurance plan(s) you are entitled to continue your coverage in the event that your employment with us ends. <br />

Under **_COBRA_**, we must offer each qualified beneficiary (the employee and any qualified dependents) who would otherwise lose coverage under the plan as a result of a qualifying event an opportunity to continue their insurance coverage. <br />

A qualifying event is defined as termination of employment, a reduction in the number of hours of employment, death of covered employment, divorce or legal separation, a dependent child ceases to be dependent, eligibility of the covered employee for Medicare, or an employer's bankruptcy. <br />

### Section 5.9 - Workers' Compensation

All states have Workers' Compensation laws whose purpose is to promote the general welfare of people by providing compensation for accidental injuries or death suffered in the course of employment. <br />

These laws are designed to provide protection to workers suffering occupational disabilities through accidents arising out of, and in the course of employment. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Devneta LLC carries Workers' Compensation for all employees and pays the entire cost of the insurance program.

An employee who suffers an injury or illness in connection with the job is usually eligible to receive payment through the insurance company for lost wages. In addition to disability payments, necessary hospital, medical, and surgical expenses are covered under Workers' Compensation, with payments being made directly to the hospital or physician. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Workers' Compensation benefits to injured workers also include assistance to help qualified injured employees return to suitable employment.

### Section 5.10 - Social Security Benefits (FICA)

During your employment, you and Devneta LLC both contribute funds to the federal government to support the **_Social Security Program_**. This program is intended to provide you with retirement benefit payments and medical coverage once you reach retirement age. <br />

### Section 5.11 - Unemployment Insurance

We pay a state and federal tax to provide employees with **_Unemployment Insurance Coverage_** in the event they become unemployed through no fault of their own or due to circumstances described by law. This insurance is administered by applicable **_state agencies_**, who determine the eligibility for benefits, the amount of benefits (if any), and duration of benefits.
