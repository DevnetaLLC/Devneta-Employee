## Section 2 - Employment Policies:

### Section 2.1 - Classifications

The following terms are used to describe employees and their employment status:

#### Exempt Employees

Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the **_Federal Labor Standards Act_** ("**_FLSA_**") and _New York_ state law. <br />

In general, exempt employees are those engaged in executive, managerial, high-level administrative and professional jobs who are paid a fixed salary and perform certain duties. In addition, certain commissioned sales employees and highly paid computer professionals are exempt. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> Exempt employees are not subject to the **_minimum wage_** and **_overtime_** laws.

#### Nonexempt Employees

Employees whose positions do not meet specific tests established by the **_FLSA_** and _New York_ state law. <br />

All employees who are covered by the federal or state minimum wage and overtime laws are considered **_nonexempt_**. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> Employees working in **_nonexempt_** jobs are entitled to be paid at least the minimum wage per hour and a premium for overtime.

#### Full-Time Employees

Employees who are not temporary employees, independent contractors, or independent consultants and are regularly scheduled to work a schedule of 40 hours per work week.

#### Part-Time Employees

Employees who are not temporary employees, independent contractors, or independent consultants and are regularly scheduled to work less than 40 hours per work week.

#### Temporary Employees

Employees who are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce or to assist in the completion of a specific project. <br />

Employment assignments in this category are of limited duration and the temporary employee can be let go before the end of the defined period. <br />

Short-term assignments generally are periods of three months or less, however, such assignments _may_ be extended. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> All temporary employees are [at-will](/main/department/human-resource/resources/handbook/section1#section-14---at-will-employment) regardless of the anticipated duration of the assignment. <br />
> Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change by the [Human Resource](mailto:hr@devneta.org) department.

#### Independent Contractor or Consultant

These individuals **are not** employees of the Company and are **_self-employed_**. <br />

An independent contractor or consultant is engaged to perform a task according to their own methods and is subject to control and direction only as to the results to be accomplished. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Independent contractors or consultants are not entitled to benefits.

### Section 2.2 - Equal Employment & Americans with Disabilities

It is our policy to provide equal employment opportunities to all _employees_ and _employment applicants_ without regard to unlawful considerations of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, marital status, or any other classification protected by applicable _local_, _state_, or _federal_ laws. <br />

This policy prohibits unlawful discrimination based on the perception that anyone has any of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of those characteristics. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, working conditions, compensation, promotion, benefits, scheduling, training, discipline, and termination. <br />

We expect all employees to support our [equal employment opportunity policy](#section-22-equal-employment--americans-with-disabilities), to take all steps necessary to maintain a workplace free from unlawful discrimination and harassment and to accommodate others in line with this policy to the **_fullest extent_** required by law.
> For example, we will make reasonable accommodations for employees' observance of religious holidays and practices unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship on our operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you desire a religious accommodation, you are required to make the request in writing to our [Human Resource](mailto:hr@devneta.org) as far in advance as possible.

You are expected to strive to find co-workers who can assist in the accommodation (e.g., trade shifts) ad cooperate with us in seeking and evaluating alternatives. <br />

Moreover, in compliance with the **_Americans with Disabilities_** ("**_ADA_**"), we provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities to the **_fullest extent_** required by law. We may require _medial certification_ of both the _disability_ and _the need for accommodation_.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that we can only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual. Therefore, it is your responsibility to come forward if you are in need of accommodation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We will engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify possible accommodations if any will help the applicant or employee perform the job.

### Section 2.3 - Confidentiality

In the course of employment with the Company, employees may have access to "**_Confidential Information_**" regarding the Company, which may include its business strategy, future plans, financial information, contracts, suppliers, customers, personnel information, or other information that the Company considers proprietary and confidential. <br />

Maintaining the confidentiality of this information is vital to our competitive position in the industry and, ultimately, to its ability to achieve financial success and stability. Employees must protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, using it only for the business of the Company, and disclosing it only when authorized to do so and to those who have a legitimate business need to know about it. <br />

This duty of confidentiality applies whether the employee is on or off our premises, and during and even after the end of the employee's employment with the Company. This duty of confidentiality also applies to communications transmitted by our electronic communications. See also [Internet, Email, and Computer Use](/main/department/human-resource/resources/handbook/section4.md#section-49---internet-email-and-computer-use-policy) policy. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> As a condition of employment with us, all employees must sign a **_Non-Disclosure Agreement_**.

### Section 2.4 - Employment of Minors

The **_FLSA_**'s child labor provisions, which we strictly adhere to, are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. <br />

Generally speaking, the **_FLSA_** sets the minimum age for employment, restricts the hours youth under the age of 16 may work, and prohibits youth under the age of 18 from being employed in hazardous occupations. In addition, the *_FLSA_* establishes subminimum wage standards for certain employees who are less than 20 years of age, full-time students, student learners, apprentices, and workers with disabilities. Employers generally must have authorization from the **_U.S Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division_** ("**_WHD_**") in order to pay sub-minimum wage rates. <br />

### Section 2.5 - Employment of Relatives

We recognize that the employment of relatives in certain circumstances, such as when they work in the same department, supervise or manage the other, or have access to confidential or sensitive information regarding the other, can cause problems related to supervision, safety, security, or morale, or create conflicts of interest that materially and substantially disrupt our operations. <br />

When we determine any of these problems will be present, it will decline to hire an individual to work in the same department as a relative. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> Relatives subject to this policy include: father, mother, sister, brother, current spouse or domestic partner, child (natural, foster, or adopted), current mother-in-law, current father-in-law, grandparent, or grand child. <br />

If present employees become relatives during employment, we should be notified so that we may determine whether a problem involving supervision, safety, security, morale, or a conflict of interest that would materially and substantially disrupt our operations exists. If we determine such a problem exists, we will take appropriate steps to resolve the problem, which may include reassignment of one relative (if feasible) or asking the resignation of one of the relatives. <br />

### Section 2.6 - Introductory Period

The first **_180 days_** of employment are considered an **_introductory period_** for **all** newly hired employees. <br />

During this time, you will learn your new responsibilities, get acquainted with fellow employees, and determine whether you are happy with the position. Also, during this time, the [Human Resource](mailto:hr@devneta.org) will monitor your performance. <br />

Upon completion of the introductory period, your manager will review your performance. If we find your performance satisfactory and decide to continue your employment, you will be advised of any improvements expected. This is also an opportunity for you to make suggestions to improve our efficiency and operations. <br />

Completion of the introductory period **_does not_** entitle you to remain employed by the Company for **any** definite period of time, but instead allows both you and the Company to evaluate whether or not you are right for the position. <br />

Your status as an **_at-will_** employee does not change the employment relationship may be terminated **_with_** or **_without_** cause and **_with_** or **_without_** advance notice, at **_any time_** by you or the Company. <br />

### Section 2.7 - Personnel Records and Employee References

> [!CAUTION]

Garrow](mailto:kgarrow@devneta.org) **_and_** our [Legal](mailto:legal@devneta.org) department. Because personnel files and payroll records are confidential, access to the records is restricted. Generally, only those who have a legitimate reason to review information in an employee's file are allowed to do so. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources is **_limited_**.

However, we will cooperate with requests from **_authorized law enforcement_** or **_local_**, **_state_**, or **_federal_** agencies conducting **_official investigations_** and as **_otherwise legally required_**. <br />

### Section 2.10 - Political Neutrality

Maintenance of individual freedom and our political institutions necessitates broad-scale participation by citizens concerning the selection, nomination, and election of our public office holders. <br />

We will not discriminate against any employee because of identification with and support of any lawful political activity. Our employees are entitled to their own personal political position. We will not discriminate against employees based on their lawful political activity engaged in outside of work. <br />

   + Reasonable break time for you to express breast milk for your nursing child as needed; and, <br />
   + A lactation space, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public. <br />
