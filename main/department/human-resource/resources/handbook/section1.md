# Employee Handbook & Policies


## Section 1 - Introduction to Devneta LLC:

### Section 1.1 - Welcome!

Welcome to [Devneta LLC](https://devneta.org)! <br />

### Section 1.2 - Our Handbook

This Employee Handbook ("Handbook") is designed to summarize certain personnel policies and benefits of [Devneta LLC](https://devneta.org) ("Company", "our", "us", "we"), of all [United States](#section-12) locations, and to acquaint employees with many of the rules concerning employment. This Handbook applies to all employees, and compliance with our policies is a condition of employment. <br />

> [!CAUTION]
> This Handbook supersedes all previous employment policies, written and oral, express and implied.

> [!CAUTION]
> We reserve the right to modify, rescind, delete, or add to the provisions of this Handbook from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion. <br />
> We reserve the right to interpret the policies in this Handbook and to deviate from them when, in our sole discretion, we determine it is appropriate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Handbook is not a binding contract between us and our employees, nor is it intended to alter the at-will employment relationship between us and our employees.

### Section 1.3 - Changes in Policy

Since our business is constantly changing, we expressly reserve the right to revise, modify, delete, or add to **any and all** policies, procedures, work rules, or benefits stated in this Handbook or in any other document, except for the policy of [At-Will Employment](#section-14-at-will-employment) as described below. <br />

No oral statements or representations can in any way alter the provisions of this Handbook. Nothing in this Handbook or in any other document, including benefit plan descriptions, creates or is intended to create a promise or representation of continued employment for any employee. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes to your [At-Will Employment](#section-14-at-will-employment) status must be in writing and must be signed by [Devneta LLC](https://devneta.org).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are uncertain about **any** policy or procedure, please contact the [Human Resource](mailto:hr@devneta.org) department.

### Section 1.4 - At-Will Employment

> [!CAUTION]
> Employment with us is on an **_at-will_** basis, unless otherwise specified in an employment agreement. <br />

You are free to resign at **any time** for **any reason**, **with** or **without** notice. Similarly, we are free to conclude the employment relationship at **any time** for **any lawful reason**, **with** or **without** cause, and **with** or **without** notice. <br />

Nothing in this Handbook will limit the right of either party to terminate an at-will employment. No section of this Handbook is meant to be construed, nor should be construed, as establishing anything other than an employment-at-will relationship. <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Handbook does not limit management's discretion in making personnel decisions such as reassignment, change of wages and benefits, demotions, etc. No person other than the CEO, President, or CFO has the authority to enter into an agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make an agreement for employment other than at-will terms. Only the CEO, President, or CFO of Devneta LLC has the authority to make any such agreement, which is only binding if it is in writing and signed by a member of our [Legal Team](mailto:legal@devneta.org).
